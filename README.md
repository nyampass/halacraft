/clj (+ 1 2 3)

## Installation

Follow these steps to download and install SpigotMC.

1. Download Spigot's [BuildTools.jar][spigotdl] 

2. Save the BuildTools.jar file to a new directory called spigotmc.

3. Open a terminal (Mac and Linux) or command prompt (windows) window and type `java -jar BuildTools.jar`. This will kick off a long series of commands to "build" SpigotMC.

4. When the build is done, there will be a new file beginning with `spigot` and ending in `.jar` in the spigotmc directory. Run this file by typing `java -jar spigot-1.15.2-R0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` (it might not be that exact name - you can list files in the directory by typing `dir` (Windows) or `ls` (Mac and Linux).
5. The server will start up then shut down very shortly afterwards. You'll need to edit a file called `eula.txt` - change `eula=false` to `eula=true` and save the file.
6. Run the `java -jar spigot-1.15.2-R0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar nogui` command again - this time the server will start up. Shut it down by typing `stop` at the server prompt.

7. Download the halacraft.jar plugin and save it to the plugins directory and restart the server by typing `java -jar spigot-1.15.2-R0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar nogui`.
